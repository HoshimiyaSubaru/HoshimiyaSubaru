# ðŸ¦¦ I'm Kisuzume! 

Welcome to my page newcomer! I'm Kisuzume, a classically-trained anime pianist of 8 years, experienced Discord bot developer, and the one-and-only jack of all trades. My fondness in music and programming comes from my motivation, and I want you to seek what **YOU** are looking towards following in the future.
